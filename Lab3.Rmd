## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Problems

##Problem 1

1. Create five samples of 25 observations from a normal distribution with mean 200, and standard deviation 100. Compute the mean of each sample, and plot the means in a graph using ggplot2. (1 point)

```{r}
my_data <- data.frame(sample_data = rnorm(125,200,100),
                      sample = rep(1:5, each=25))

library(ggplot2)
library(dbplyr)

means <- my_data %>%
  group_by(sample)%>%
  summarise(sample_mean = mean(sample_data))

ggplot(means, aes(x=sample, y=sample_mean))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

```

` Confidence level: 15 ` 



##Problem 2
2. Additionally calculate the standard deviation of each sample from above. Use the standard deviations for error bars, and produce another graph with the means along with error bars using ggplot2. (1 point)


```{r}
my_data <- data.frame(sample_data = rnorm(125,200,100),
                      sample = rep(1:5, each=25))

library(ggplot2)
library(dbplyr)

means <- my_data %>%
  group_by(sample)%>%
  summarise(sample_mean = mean(sample_data),
            sample_sd = sd(sample_data))

ggplot(means, aes(x=sample, y=sample_mean))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = sample_mean-sample_sd,
                    ymax = sample_mean+sample_sd),
                width = .25)+
  ylab("Mean")+
  xlab("Sample")+
  theme_classic()+
  ggtitle("Sample Means With Error Bars")

```

` Confidence level: 95 with the help of previous example and Lab2 ` 



##Problem 3

3. Demonstrate that the sample mean across a range of n, is an unbiased estimator of the population mean using a monte-carlo simulation. (2 points).
- The population is a normal distribution with mean = 10, standard deviation = 5.
- Test a variety of n (sample size), including n = 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100
- For each sample size n, your task is to draw 10,000 samples of that size, then for each sample, calculate the sample mean. If the mean is unbiased, then we expect that “on average” the sample means will be the same as the population mean. To determine if this is true, compute the mean of the sample means that you produce to see if it is close to the population mean.
- Show the mean of the sample means for each sample size.


```{r}

sample_sizes <- c(2,5,10,50,100)
sim_sample_means <- c()

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
population <- rnorm(sample_sizes[i]*10000, mean=10, sd=5)
samples <- rep(1:10000, each = sample_sizes[i])
my_data <- data.frame(samples, population)


sum_data <- my_data%>%
  group_by(samples)%>%
  summarize(sample_means = mean(population))

sim_sample_means[i] <- (mean(sum_data$sample_means))

}


# organize results in dataframe
sim_data <- data.frame(sample_sizes,
                       sim_sample_means)

# graph results
ggplot(sim_data,aes(x=sample_sizes,y=sim_sample_means, group = 1))+
  geom_line(colour = "green")+
  geom_point(colour = "blue", size = 3)+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(9.75,10.25))+
  ylab("Sample Means")+
  xlab("Sample Sizes")+
  theme_classic()+
  ggtitle("Sample Means Across a Range of N")


```

` Confidence level: about 10.`
`I was on a right way, I made a loop, but I didn't know how to assign "n" in the loop to 2, 5, 10 etc. (i.e "sample_sizes[i]"). I originally just created a vector n <- c(2,5..) and in the loop I wrote "population <- rnorm(n*10000, mean=10, sd=5)", but of course it didn't work. Also I wrote "for i in n" instead of "i in 1:length(sample_sizes)"`
